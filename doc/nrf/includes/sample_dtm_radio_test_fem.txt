You can add support for the nRF21540 front-end module (FEM) to the sample.

To add support for the nRF21540 FEM, build the sample for a board containing nRF21540 FEM like :ref:`nrf21540dk_nrf52840 <zephyr:nrf21540dk_nrf52840>` or create a devicetree overlay file describing how FEM is connected to nRF5 SoC in your device.

.. note::
   If you use the nRF21540 EK, append ``nrf21540_ek`` shield to your build command instructing build system to append the appropriate devicetree overlay file.
   If you use the nRF21540 DK, build your application for the :ref:`nrf21540dk_nrf52840 <zephyr:nrf21540dk_nrf52840>` board.
   The devicetree for the nRF21540 DK already contains the required FEM configuration, so you do not need to set an additional build option.

For example, to build the sample from the command line for an nRF5340 DK with an attached nRF21540 EK, invoke the following command within the sample directory:
``west build -b nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpunet -- -DSHIELD=nrf21540_ek``

.. note::
   The nRF5340 DK network core peripherals, like UART and SPI, share an ID and a base address.
   To configure the nRF21540 front-end module gain, write the gain value over the SPI.
   In samples, UART is used as a control interface or shell transport.
   To send the gain value UART is temporary disabled and restarted after the SPI transfer.
